# odin-recipes
This is the first project of the Odin-Project line of projects.
This project will help me get the basics of HTML down, including the formatting of a HTML file, making unordered and ordered list as well as creating and using the anchor tag to make links.

I will be creating a index.html to house a link to the "recipes" directory which will house my *recipes*.html pages(name after the recipe you want). Have three different *recipe*.html pages

*recipe*.html will house an -h1- heading with the name of the recipe.
A picture of the finished recipe will be under this -h1-.
Then -h3- heading "Description" followed by -p- describing the dish
Then -h3- "Ingredients" followed by -ul- of the ingredients
Finally -h3- "Steps" followed by -ol- of the steps to make recipe
